# LAFF: Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers

This repo contains code that is used to follow the [LAFF: Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers](https://www.edx.org/course/laff-linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers) course on [edx](https://www.edx.org/).

Most of the code is given at the beginning of the course. 

The code I have written myself is located in the **Homework** folder.

## Running things

You will need [Matlab](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) or [Octave](https://octave.org/) to run things

Personally, I used the Octave CLI and [Microsoft Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Octave plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toasty-technologies.octave).
